"""Transcript-source adapter — locate + reverse-read Claude Code transcripts.

Claude Code stores one JSONL transcript per session at
``~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session_id>.jsonl``. We find it by
globbing on the session id (the filename), which avoids depending on the
exact cwd-encoding scheme.

Reads stream BACKWARD from the end with early exit: the last human prompt
is near the tail, so this stays cheap even on a multi-megabyte transcript
(the poll path must hold well under the page's cadence at many sessions).
